## Fork & create a branch

If you want to contribute with code, please fork the repository and create a new branch from `main`.

## Code Style

Please follow the standard Rust coding conventions. Run `cargo fmt` before committing your changes to ensure your code is properly formatted.

## Submitting a pull request

When you're finished with your changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Don't forget to link the PR to the issue if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge.
- Once you submit your PR, a maintainer will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
